Objective: Implement a variant of the Tomasulo algorithm

Assignment: 
~~~~~~~~~~~

Implement a variant of the Tomasulo algorithm for our simple
architecture. You have lots of flexibility in your implementation
but you need to have:

- One or more loads units (handling memory loads)
- One or more fixed-point units (handling fixed-point instructions)
  at 4 words)
- Allow instructions to commit out-of-order (no re-order buffer)
- no store instructions (to keep things simple)
- you don't have to use my registers. I replaced them with an inline array of regs
- 2 kinds of asynchronous memory read ports.

    - Port #1 (faster) should be used for fetching instructions
    - Port #2 (slower) should be used for loads

- Add a test case (testu) that has an IPC > 1. Feel free to change the
  memory interface by adding more ports of the same kind if you need to.
  
- instruction set

  encoding          instruction   description
    
  0000iiiiiiiitttt  mov i,t       regs[t] = i; pc += 1;
  0001aaaabbbbtttt  add a,b,t     regs[t] = regs[a] + regs[b]; pc += 1;
  0010jjjjjjjjjjjj  jmp j         pc = j;
  0011000000000000  halt          <stop fetching instructions>
  0100iiiiiiiitttt  ld i,t        regs[t] = mem[i]; pc += 1;
  0101aaaabbbbtttt  ldr a,b,t     regs[t] = mem[regs[a]+regs[b]]; pc += 1;
  0110aaaabbbbtttt  jeq a,b,t     if (regs[a] == regs[b]) pc += d
                                  else pc += 1;

Files you can change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cpu.v contains the implementation. You are required to use the provided
memory (mem.v) and clock (clock.v)

Files to leave alone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Makefile, clock.v, mem.v, counter.v, test.ok, mem.hex

To compile
~~~~~~~~~~

    make

To run all tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test

To run one test (e.g. test1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make test1

Will also produce cpu.vcd which can be viewed in gtkwave
